#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
Carol mostly worked on getting the app to run faster, better, and higher.  She did the best work possible but her contributions were overpowered and not well received by the fans.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + Managing pull requests and merges
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + We were all new to git/github and not everyone followed convention
  + How was the challenge addressed?
  + I went to the TA for help and used ChatGPT and web resources to get more comfortable with git.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Finally getting the IDs from the API calls to store in the ROOM database
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would get the ROOM database setup FIRST
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Do the work early and document EVERYTHING

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I led the Room database implementation for user accounts and persistence, improved the app’s UI, added full dark mode theming, and implemented the high score system that saves and displays each user’s best score from the database.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + Fixing the Gradle Sync errors.
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + Diffrent platforms, caused some gradle issues that I have never seen before. It caused me to merge my first PR dark.
  + How was the challenge addressed?
  + I used ChatGPT for help, and also asked Roberto once.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + To be honest nothing, but to answer this question I would say trying diffrent UI themes was somewhat "interesting".
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + Not take Gradle Sync issues lightly, and try to be the first one to commit to the Repo so everyone else would follow.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Do the work early and document everything simultaenously. As we have already finished our project and tomorrow is submission, its sort of hard to recall where i found dificulty for the stuff I did 3 weeks ago.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I mainly worked on the gameplay screen UI providing feedback for correct and incorrect guesses, smoothly transitioning between rounds, and the help screen providing gameplay instructions.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + Learning how to properly review pull requests
+ Why was it a challenge?
  +  This was my first time using pull requests
  +Initially I didn't know how to properly review a pull request
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + I went to the TA for help and used ChatGPT and web resources to get more comfortable with git.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + In class lectures about how to be a good reviewer
  + Researching online best practices
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would probably use only one activity rather than two
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Definitely learning GitHub issues + pull requests and how to be a code reviewer
