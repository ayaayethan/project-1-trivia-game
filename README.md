#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I built the base skeleton for the app screen flow and tracking score. I also implemented preloading of images to improve load times in the app.
+ What was the biggest challenge? 
+ Biggest challenge was learning Kotlin and Composable UI
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + I have used Java plenty before, but the structure of the Composable UI is something I have never done before. Having that learning curve while also working in a group was a new challenge.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
 + Reviewing examples and iterating to see what worked allowed me to get an idea of what was expected.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + The final product was very satisfying, it plays like a real game. Being able to see how it all works under the hood is a great insight.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would use GitHub issues a lot more, to make sure I always had something to do.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + I learned that merge conflicts can very easily present a brick wall, and that it's important to communicate with your teammates to avoid breaking their changes.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I led the Room database implementation for user accounts and persistence, improved the app’s UI, added full dark mode theming, and implemented the high score system that saves and displays each user’s best score from the database.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + Fixing the Gradle Sync errors.
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + Diffrent platforms, caused some gradle issues that I have never seen before. It caused me to merge my first PR dark.
  + How was the challenge addressed?
  + I used ChatGPT for help, and also asked Roberto once.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + To be honest nothing, but to answer this question I would say trying diffrent UI themes was somewhat "interesting".
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + Not take Gradle Sync issues lightly, and try to be the first one to commit to the Repo so everyone else would follow.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Do the work early and document everything simultaenously. As we have already finished our project and tomorrow is submission, its sort of hard to recall where i found dificulty for the stuff I did 3 weeks ago.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I mainly worked on the gameplay screen UI providing feedback for correct and incorrect guesses, smoothly transitioning between rounds, and the help screen providing gameplay instructions.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + Learning how to properly review pull requests
+ Why was it a challenge?
  +  This was my first time using pull requests
  +Initially I didn't know how to properly review a pull request
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + I went to the TA for help and used ChatGPT and web resources to get more comfortable with git.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + In class lectures about how to be a good reviewer
  + Researching online best practices
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would probably use only one activity rather than two
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Definitely learning GitHub issues + pull requests and how to be a code reviewer


## Conclusion

- How successful was the project?
  - I think the project was a complete success. We met all deadlines efficiently, all of the team members were competent and focused to understand the situation properly. Overall Team dynamics were very high and smooth and there was no communication gaps in between. 
- What was the largest victory?
 - The Larget VICTORY was when we got the main game functionality working. When the images were properly showing up and it was actually recording our scores and saving it to the database, we all felt so much accomplished.
- Final assessment of the project
 - This project was very helpful in preparing us for both capstone and real-life projects. This project taught us that communication and documentation is key. Though we succeeded at communication, we never thought of the later. The project is finished and right now while filling this Readme we are scravenging around our previous submissions to look for our orginal plans and user stories. Documenting changes and enhancement is key. As a conclusion of this assesment, we would like to say that overall, our actions were very quick and decisive while fixing bugs and errors, overall Team cooporation was very high. And if we get a chance, we will do it again.
